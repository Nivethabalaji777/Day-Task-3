### Difference Between Window, Screen & Document in JavaScript

  
Window

window is the main JavaScript object root, and the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window. you can reference any properties of it with just the property name — so you do not have to write down _window._ - it will be figured out by the runtime.

 window.property

The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

Window properties include

-   `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` binding event handlers to a timer
-   `location` giving the current URL
-   `history` with methods `back()` and `forward()` giving the tab's mutable history
-   `navigator` describing the browser software

**Screen**

Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:

-   screen properties `width` and `height` are the full screen
-   screen properties `availWidth` and `availHeight` omit the toolbar

**Document**

Document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.

The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.

**Conclusion**

_window_ and _document_ belong to DOM, _screen_ doesn't. You need all of them, however because _document_ and _screen_ are both properties of window object, you can just invoke them directly in your code (shortening the code). More, _screen_ being about the hardware part, not any browsers' rectangular available area to render on, it hasn't the meaning of document.body . At most, you can put screen data to use in order to optimize your loading page, for example limiting the assets downloads for a better mobile device experience and so on.
